# Full Diagnostic Caveat Analysis (6615-case run)

> **Historical document:** This analysis reflects validation state as of 2026-05-15, before v0.1.15 baseline promotion. **Current baseline:** v0.1.15-s2-s1-product-discretized-full (promoted 2026-05-16).

**Run:** `20260515-201150_s2_s1_product_discretized_full`  
**Date:** 2026-05-15  
**Baseline:** `v0.1.14-mvp-s2-s1-discretization-v2-full` *(pre-promotion)*

## Overview

Full 6615-case diagnostic identified **two caveats** in product-discretized S²×S¹ operator validation:

1. **Ring family alpha=0 fragility:** 51 localization failures (37 complete both-gate failures + 14 window-sensitive; 52 in summary.md counter due to clean control inclusion)
2. **v2/v3 gate disagreement:** 7 cases where v2 passes but v3 (stricter) fails — all localized to ring/alpha=0, treated as minor window-gate edge cases

Both caveats are **ring family specific** and concentrated at **alpha=0 (periodic boundary)**.

---

## Caveat 1: Ring Alpha=0 Failures

### Scope

- **Failure count:** 52 cases (summary.md counter) / 51 cases (metrics.json analysis — 1 case discrepancy, likely clean control inclusion)
- **Total ring alpha=0 disordered cases:** ~630
- **Failure rate:** 8.3% (51/630 or 52/630 depending on counter)

**Gate status breakdown (verified from metrics.json):**
- **37 cases (73%):** BOTH gates fail (`kernel_only=False` AND `fixed_window=False`) — complete localization failure
- **14 cases (27%):** Window-sensitive (`kernel_only=False`, `fixed_window=True`) — kernel-only fails, fixed-window passes
- **Total:** 51 ring alpha=0 disordered cases fail kernel-only gate; 37 of these also fail fixed-window gate

**v3 classification:** 37 both-fail cases classified as `"fail"` (complete failure); 14 window-sensitive cases exhibit historical window-selection sensitivity pattern

### Parameter Distribution

**By s1_size (lattice size):**
```
s1_size=8:  25 failures (49% of failures)
s1_size=24: 19 failures (37% of failures)
s1_size=32:  3 failures (6%)
s1_size=48:  3 failures (6%)
s1_size=16:  1 failure  (2%)
```

**Pattern:** Concentrated on **small lattices** (s1_size ≤ 24 accounts for 86% of failures).

**By disorder strength:**
```
W=2.0:  17 failures (33%)
W=4.0:  16 failures (31%)
W=6.0:   9 failures (18%)
W=12.0:  9 failures (18%)
```

**Pattern:** Dominated by **lower-to-moderate disorder** (W ≤ 6.0 accounts for 82% of failures). Strong disorder (W=12.0) shows fewer failures.

**By monopole charge:**
```
q=0:  19 failures (37%)
q=±3: 15 failures (29%)
q=±1: 14 failures (27%)
q=2:   3 failures (6%)
```

**Pattern:** q=0 (monopole-free) shows highest failure count, but this may reflect higher sampling density.

### 14 Window-Sensitive Cases (Kernel Fail, Fixed Pass)

**Subset detail:** Of the 51 total failures, 14 cases (27%) pass fixed-window gate but fail kernel-only gate — exhibiting the historical window-selection sensitivity pattern.

**By s1_size:**
```
s1_size=8:  10 cases (71% of window-sensitive)
s1_size=24:  4 cases (29% of window-sensitive)
```

**By disorder strength:**
```
W=12.0: 6 cases (43% of window-sensitive) — strong disorder
W=4.0:  4 cases (29%)
W=6.0:  2 cases (14%)
W=2.0:  2 cases (14%)
```

**Key observation:** 43% of window-sensitive cases occur at **W=12.0** (strong disorder), contrasting with the 37 complete failures which concentrate at W≤6.0. This suggests window-sensitivity may be a **different mechanism** from complete localization failure — possibly related to spectral window definition at strong disorder rather than fundamental ring discretization fragility.

### Sample Cases

**Example 1:** s1_size=8, q=0, W=2.0, seed=42
- kernel_only: False
- fixed_window: False
- v3_classification: "fail"

**Example 2:** s1_size=24, q=3, W=4.0, seed=123
- kernel_only: False
- fixed_window: False
- v3_classification: "fail"

### Comparison to Historical Issue

**Historical (2026-05-14):** Ring window-selection sensitivity
- **Symptom:** kernel_only=False, fixed_window=True (window-selection sensitivity)
- **Seeds:** 12051, 12053, 9836055
- **Resolution (2026-05-15):** Implementation improvements → all three seeds now pass BOTH gates
- **Status:** Pytest 195/195 passed

**Full grid (2026-05-15):** Ring alpha=0 failures — two patterns observed

**Pattern 1: Complete failures (37 cases, 73%)**
- **Symptom:** kernel_only=False, fixed_window=False (BOTH gates fail)
- **Seeds:** Various (different from historical)
- **Parameter concentration:** W=2.0–6.0 (low-moderate disorder), s1_size≤24

**Pattern 2: Window-sensitive failures (14 cases, 27%)**
- **Symptom:** kernel_only=False, fixed_window=True (SAME as historical window-selection sensitivity)
- **Seeds:** Various (different from historical 12051/12053/9836055)
- **Parameter concentration:** W=12.0 (6 cases, 43% of window-sensitive), s1_size={8, 24}
- **Interpretation:** Historical pattern persists at different seeds/parameters

**Key distinction:** Pytest resolution (2026-05-15) was **seed-specific** — those three seeds now pass. Full grid reveals:
1. **37 new complete failures** at different parameter combinations (different failure mode from historical)
2. **14 cases exhibiting historical window-selection pattern** at different seeds (same pattern, different parameters)

This is **not a regression** — pytest validated that specific seeds were fixed. Full grid provides the **broader statistical picture**, showing:
- Window-selection sensitivity pattern persists at other seeds/parameters (14 cases)
- New complete-failure mode exists (37 cases)
- Both localized to ring alpha=0, not spectral_circle/wilson_ring

### Interpretation

1. **Lattice size dependence:** Small lattices (s1_size=8, 24) are more fragile. Possible causes:
   - Insufficient spectral resolution for localization detection
   - Discretization artifacts dominate at coarse resolution
   - Ring family construction less stable at small N

2. **Disorder strength dependence:** Lower disorder (W=2.0–6.0) fails more often than strong disorder (W=12.0). Possible causes:
   - Moderate disorder sits in transition regime (neither delocalized nor strongly localized)
   - Anderson localization threshold effects
   - Gate criteria optimized for strong disorder regime

3. **Alpha=0 specificity:** Failures concentrated at alpha=0 (periodic boundary). Possible causes:
   - Ring discretization boundary condition implementation issue
   - Spectral degeneracy at periodic boundary
   - Numerical stability of ring construction for closed circle

### Recommendation

**Immediate:**
- Document as known limitation (ring family, alpha=0, small lattices, moderate disorder)
- Flag in validation reports
- Do NOT block full diagnostic completion (52/6615 = 0.8% total failure rate)

**Investigation (future):**
- Compare ring construction to spectral_circle/wilson_ring at alpha=0
- Test ring family at larger s1_size (64, 96) to check lattice-size scaling
- Check ring discretization boundary condition implementation
- Consider whether ring family should be deprecated for alpha=0 case

## Caveat 2: v2/v3 Gate Disagreement

### Scope

- **Disagreement count:** 7 cases
- **Pattern:** ALL cases show v2=True (fixed-window passes), v3=False (window-robust fails)
- **Family:** ALL ring family
- **Alpha:** ALL alpha=0.0

### Parameter Distribution

**All 7 cases:**
```
Case 1: ring, s1_size=8,  q=-3, W=2.0,  alpha=0.0, seed=...
Case 2: ring, s1_size=24, q=-1, W=4.0,  alpha=0.0, seed=...
Case 3: ring, s1_size=8,  q=1,  W=6.0,  alpha=0.0, seed=...
Case 4: ring, s1_size=24, q=3,  W=12.0, alpha=0.0, seed=...
Case 5: ring, s1_size=8,  q=-1, W=2.0,  alpha=0.0, seed=...
Case 6: ring, s1_size=24, q=1,  W=4.0,  alpha=0.0, seed=...
Case 7: ring, s1_size=8,  q=3,  W=6.0,  alpha=0.0, seed=...
```

**Common factors:**
- s1_family: ring (100%)
- alpha: 0.0 (100%)
- disorder_strength: ≥2.0 (100%, all disordered)

**Variable factors:**
- s1_size: {8, 24}
- q: {-3, -1, 1, 3}
- W: {2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 12.0}

### Gate Definitions

**v2 gate (fixed-window):**
- Uses single fixed low-energy window
- Checks IPR contrast: disordered_mean / clean_mean > threshold
- More permissive (single window measurement)

**v3 gate (window-robust):**
- Tests multiple window sizes (adaptive)
- Requires consistent localization across window variations
- Stricter (detects window-selection sensitivity)

### Interpretation

**v2 limitation:** Cases that pass v2 but fail v3 show **window-selection sensitivity** — localization appears robust in ONE window size, but fragile when window changes. v3 correctly identifies this as unreliable.

**v3 advantage:** Window-robust gate prevents false positives from lucky window choices.

**Ring family pattern:** 100% of disagreements are ring family → ring shows higher window sensitivity than spectral_circle/wilson_ring.

### Recommendation

**Gate policy:**
- Treat v3 (window-robust) as **primary gate** for production validation
- v2 gate may be too permissive — consider deprecation or use only as preliminary screen
- Cases with v2=True, v3=False should be flagged as "window-sensitive, unreliable"

**Ring family:**
- Document window sensitivity as ring-specific limitation
- Consider stricter validation criteria for ring family

## Overall Assessment

### Core Validation: PASSED ✅

All primary gates passed:
- Hermiticity, shape consistency, reproducibility: 100%
- q=0 false positive control: 0 spurious localization
- Clean vs disordered contrast: available for all families

### Caveats: 2 DOCUMENTED ⚠️

1. Ring alpha=0 fragility: 8.3% failure rate (small lattices, moderate disorder)
2. v2/v3 disagreement: 7 cases (v2 too permissive, v3 correct)

### Impact on Baseline

**Baseline status:** UNCHANGED (`v0.1.14-mvp-s2-s1-discretization-v2-full`)

**Rationale:**
- Core operator construction validated (Hermiticity, controls)
- Caveats are **documented limitations**, not blocking bugs
- Failure rate (0.8% total, 8.3% ring alpha=0) does not invalidate overall diagnostic
- Pytest suite remains green (195/195)

### Scientific Claims

**Unchanged non-claims:**
- Does NOT prove continuum compactification
- Does NOT validate S⁶ or S³×S⁶
- Does NOT derive Standard Model
- Does NOT prove physical chirality
- Does NOT bypass Witten/Lichnerowicz

**Scope:** Numerical laboratory for toy covariant compactification mechanisms (cutoff=2, pedagogical).
