# Independent Within-Project Audit — S² × S¹ Product-Discretized Full Diagnostic

> **Historical document:** This audit reflects validation state as of 2026-05-16, before v0.1.15 baseline promotion. **Current baseline:** v0.1.15-s2-s1-product-discretized-full (promoted 2026-05-16 after this audit).

**Audit Date:** 2026-05-16  
**Baseline:** `v0.1.14-mvp-s2-s1-discretization-v2-full` *(pre-promotion, unchanged at audit time)*  
**Run:** `reports/RUNS/20260515-201150_s2_s1_product_discretized_full/`  
**Auditor:** Independent within-project artifact audit (systematic artifact cross-check)  
**Note:** This is an internal cross-validation audit, not an external peer review.

**Verdict:** `confirmed_with_corrections_needed`

---

## Executive Summary

The 6615-case full diagnostic **core claims are VERIFIED** from run artifacts. All primary gates (Hermiticity, reproducibility, q=0 controls, cross-family robustness) passed as documented. **Two interpretation discrepancies identified** requiring corrections in FULL_CAVEAT_ANALYSIS.md:

1. **Ring alpha=0 failure breakdown:** Documentation states "BOTH gates fail" for all 52 cases, but metrics.json reveals **37 both-fail + 14 window-sensitive** (kernel fail, fixed pass).
2. **Window-sensitivity persistence:** The 14 window-sensitive cases exhibit the **historical window-selection pattern** that was "resolved" in pytest — resolution was for specific seeds, but full grid reveals pattern persists at different parameter combinations.

**Recommendation:** Update FULL_CAVEAT_ANALYSIS.md to distinguish 37 complete failures from 14 window-sensitive cases. Verdict remains `PASS_WITH_LOCAL_CAVEATS` after correction.

---

## Caveat Verification

### Caveat 1: Ring Alpha=0 Failures

**Documented claim (summary.md):** `ring_alpha0_failure_count: 52`

**Verified from metrics.json:**
- Total ring alpha=0 disordered failures: **51** (1-case discrepancy, likely rounding or clean control inclusion)
- Breakdown:
  - **37 cases:** BOTH `kernel_only_localization_gate_passed=False` AND `fixed_window_localization_gate_passed=False` (complete failure)
  - **14 cases:** `kernel_only_localization_gate_passed=False` but `fixed_window_localization_gate_passed=True` (window-sensitive)

**DISCREPANCY IDENTIFIED ⚠️:**

FULL_CAVEAT_ANALYSIS.md line 27 states:
> **Gate status:** BOTH `kernel_only_localization_gate_passed=False` AND `fixed_window_localization_gate_passed=False`

This describes **only 37 cases**, not all 52. The remaining **14 cases exhibit window-selection sensitivity** (kernel fail, fixed pass) — the same pattern as the historical issue (2026-05-14) that was "resolved" in pytest.

**Parameter distribution (all 51 failures):**

| Parameter | Distribution | Matches Documented Claim |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **s1_size** | {8: 25, 24: 19, 32: 3, 48: 3, 16: 1} | ✅ "86% s1_size≤24" verified |
| **Disorder (W)** | {2.0: 17, 4.0: 16, 6.0: 9, 12.0: 9} | ✅ "82% W≤6.0" verified |
| **Monopole (q)** | Spread across all q | ✅ Confirmed |
| **Alpha** | 100% alpha=0.0 | ✅ Confirmed |

**14 window-sensitive cases breakdown:**
- **s1_size:** {8: 10, 24: 4} — small lattices
- **Disorder:** {12.0: 6, 4.0: 4, 6.0: 2, 2.0: 2} — **43% at W=12.0** (strong disorder)

**Interpretation refinement needed:**

The 14 window-sensitive cases are **not** "complete failures" — they PASS the fixed-window gate. This is the **historical window-selection sensitivity pattern** (kernel-only fails, fixed-window passes) that was documented in earlier diagnostics and pytest. Pytest resolution (2026-05-15, seeds 12051/12053/9836055) confirmed those specific seeds now pass. Full grid reveals the **pattern persists at different seeds/parameters** — not a regression, but a more complete picture.

**Recommended correction:** Update FULL_CAVEAT_ANALYSIS.md to:
1. Distinguish "37 complete failures (both gates)" from "14 window-sensitive (kernel-only)"
2. Note that 14 window-sensitive cases exhibit the historical pattern at different parameter combinations
3. Clarify that pytest resolution was seed-specific, not pattern-elimination

### Caveat 2: v2/v3 Gate Disagreements

**Documented claim (summary.md):** `v2_vs_v3_disagreement_count: 7`

**Verified from metrics.json:**
- Total v2/v3 disagreements: **7** ✅
- All ring family: **7/7** (100%) ✅
- All alpha=0.0: **7/7** (100%) ✅
- Disorder distribution: {2.0: 2, 4.0: 1, 6.0: 2, 12.0: 2} ✅

**Overlap with ring alpha=0 failures:** 6 out of 7 v2/v3 disagreements also appear in the 51 ring alpha=0 failures.

**Finding:** v2/v3 disagreement claim **fully verified**. All disagreements are ring-specific, alpha=0, as documented.

---

## Failure Rate Verification

**Documented claim (MILESTONE):** "Total failure rate: **0.8%** (52/6615)"

**Verified calculation:**
- Total disordered failures: **51**
- Total disordered cases: **5670**
- **Disordered failure rate: 0.90%** (51/5670)
- Total cases: **6615**
- **Total failure rate: 0.77%** (51/6615)

**Minor discrepancy:** Documented 0.8% vs verified 0.77% — negligible (rounding or 52 vs 51 count difference).

**Clean control "failures":** 945 clean controls correctly show no localization (disorder_strength=0) — these are **expected** non-localizations, not bugs. Documentation correctly excludes these from "failure" count.

---

## Documentation Consistency Check

### ✅ Consistent Claims Across Documents

The following claims are **consistent** across all 6 documentation files:

1. Core gates passed (Hermiticity, q=0, reproducibility)
2. 6615 total cases
3. Classification: `product_discretized_full_diagnostic_complete`
4. Ring alpha=0 failures ~52 (all documents)
5. v2/v3 disagreements = 7 (all documents)
6. Baseline unchanged
7. Scientific non-claims (continuum compactification, S⁶, Standard Model, etc.)

### ⚠️ Inconsistency: "BOTH gates fail" interpretation

**FULL_CAVEAT_ANALYSIS.md** and **S2_S1_PRODUCT_DISCRETIZED_FULL_NOTE.md** both state:

> "Both kernel-only AND fixed-window gates fail"

This is **accurate for 37 cases**, but **inaccurate for 14 cases** (which pass fixed-window). The 14 cases should be classified as "window-sensitive" per historical nomenclature, not "complete failures."

**Other documents** (MILESTONE, VALIDATION_STATUS, SPECTRAL_REPORT, ISSUES_SCIENTIFIC) use more general language ("52 failures", "ring alpha=0 fragility") without specifying gate breakdown — these are **acceptable** as high-level summaries.

## Pytest Verification

**Command:** `pytest -q`

**Expected:** 195 passed, 1 warning (no regressions from audit changes)

**Result:** [To be executed after audit report creation]

## Audit Findings Summary

### ✅ VERIFIED (No Corrections Needed)

1. **Core gates:** All passed as documented (Hermiticity, q=0 controls, reproducibility, shape)
2. **Cross-family robustness:** Spectral_circle and wilson_ring show zero disordered failures
3. **Failure localization:** 100% of disordered failures are ring alpha=0 (verified)
4. **Parameter concentration:** 86% small lattices, 82% moderate disorder (verified)
5. **v2/v3 disagreements:** 7 cases, all ring alpha=0 (verified)
6. **Total failure rate:** ~0.8% (verified as 0.77%, negligible difference)
7. **Baseline unchanged:** Confirmed in all artifacts
8. **Scientific non-claims:** Consistently stated across all documents

### ⚠️ CORRECTIONS NEEDED

**Issue 1: Ring alpha=0 failure breakdown**

**Location:** `reports/FULL_CAVEAT_ANALYSIS.md` (lines 24-28, Caveat 1 section)

**Current statement:**
> **Failure count:** 52 cases (summary.md) / 51 cases (metrics.json analysis — 1 case discrepancy, likely clean control vs disordered filtering)
> 
> **Gate status:** BOTH `kernel_only_localization_gate_passed=False` AND `fixed_window_localization_gate_passed=False`

**Correction required:**
```markdown
**Failure count:** 52 cases (summary.md) / 51 cases (metrics.json analysis — 1 case discrepancy, likely clean control vs disordered filtering)

**Gate status breakdown:**
- **37 cases (73%):** BOTH gates fail (`kernel_only=False` AND `fixed_window=False`) — complete localization failure
- **14 cases (27%):** Window-sensitive (`kernel_only=False`, `fixed_window=True`) — historical window-selection sensitivity pattern

**Total:** 51 ring alpha=0 disordered cases fail kernel-only gate; 37 also fail fixed-window gate.
```

**Issue 2: Window-sensitivity interpretation**

**Location:** `reports/FULL_CAVEAT_ANALYSIS.md` (Comparison to Historical Issue section)

**Add clarification:**
```markdown
**Window-sensitivity persistence:** The 14 window-sensitive cases (kernel fail, fixed pass) exhibit the same pattern as the historical issue (2026-05-14: seeds 12051, 12053, 9836055). Pytest resolution confirmed those specific seeds now pass both gates. Full grid reveals the **pattern persists at different seeds and parameter combinations** (43% of window-sensitive cases occur at W=12.0, strong disorder). This is not a regression — pytest validated seed-specific fixes; full grid provides the broader statistical picture showing the pattern remains at other parameter points.
```

**Impact:** Minor — does not change verdict (`PASS_WITH_LOCAL_CAVEATS`), but provides more accurate characterization of the 51 failures as "37 complete + 14 window-sensitive" rather than "52 complete."

---

## Verdict

**`confirmed_with_corrections_needed`**

### Rationale

**Core claims VERIFIED:**
- All primary gates passed
- 6615-case grid completed successfully
- Classification accurate
- Failure localization to ring alpha=0 confirmed
- Cross-family robustness (spectral_circle, wilson_ring) verified
- v2/v3 disagreements verified

**Interpretation refinements needed:**
- Distinguish 37 "complete failures" (both gates) from 14 "window-sensitive" (kernel-only)
- Clarify that window-sensitivity pattern persists at different parameters, not eliminated
- Update FULL_CAVEAT_ANALYSIS.md with corrected breakdown

**Verdict remains `PASS_WITH_LOCAL_CAVEATS` after corrections:**
- Caveats remain localized to ring alpha=0 (0.77% total failure rate)
- Spectral_circle and wilson_ring fully robust (recommended for production)
- 14 window-sensitive cases are documented limitation, not blocking bug
- Core operator correctness validated across full grid

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Before Baseline Promotion)

1. **Update FULL_CAVEAT_ANALYSIS.md** with corrected gate breakdown (37 both + 14 window-sensitive)
2. **Add window-sensitivity persistence note** clarifying relationship to historical issue
3. **Re-run pytest -q** to verify no regressions from documentation updates

### Optional (Post-Audit Follow-Ups)

1. **Ring alpha=0 investigation:**
   - Test ring at larger s1_size (64, 96) to check if failures scale with lattice size
   - Compare ring boundary condition implementation to spectral_circle/wilson_ring
   - Investigate why 43% of window-sensitive cases occur at W=12.0 (strong disorder)

2. **Window-sensitivity deep dive:**
   - Characterize the 14 window-sensitive seeds systematically
   - Determine if numerical stability improvements (as applied to historical seeds) can resolve these cases
   - Document whether window-sensitivity is inherent to ring discretization or fixable

3. **S1 family policy:**
   - Recommend spectral_circle or wilson_ring as primary families for alpha=0 (periodic boundary)
   - Consider deprecating ring for alpha=0 or marking as "experimental/fragile"
   - Update benchmark defaults based on full-grid robustness evidence

### Baseline Promotion Path

```
Audit corrections applied
   ↓
Documentation consistency verified
   ↓
Pytest passes (195 passed, 1 warning)
   ↓
External reviewer sign-off (optional)
   ↓
v0.1.15 candidate review
   ↓
Promotion decision
```

**Blocking requirement:** FULL_CAVEAT_ANALYSIS.md corrections must be applied before promotion. Current interpretation ("BOTH gates fail" for all 52) is **misleading** — 14 cases pass fixed-window gate.
