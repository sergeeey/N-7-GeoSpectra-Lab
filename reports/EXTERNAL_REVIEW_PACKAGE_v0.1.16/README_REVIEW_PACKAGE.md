# External Review Package — v0.1.16 Compressed Methodology Manuscript

**Package Date:** 2026-05-17  
**Manuscript Version:** v0.1.16  
**Baseline:** v0.1.15-s2-s1-product-discretized-full  
**Status:** READY FOR EXTERNAL REVIEW

---

## Purpose

This package contains materials for **external domain expert peer review** of the GeoSpectra Falsification Ladder methodology paper. The paper presents a **falsification-first validation harness** for discretized spectral operators on compact toy manifolds, validated through the v0.1.15 case study (S²×S¹ product-discretized full diagnostic).

**This is a methodology paper, NOT a physical compactification proof.**

## Scope: Finite-Lattice Toy Diagnostics

**What this paper validates:**

✅ **Methodology:** Falsification-first workflow for discretized toy operators on finite lattices  
✅ **Case study:** S²×S¹ product-discretized validation (q≤106, s1_size≤96)  
✅ **Workflow components:** Controls, progressive profiles, independent audit, targeted follow-up, caveat handling  
✅ **Ring/alpha=0 resolution:** Small-lattice artifact, converges at s1_size≥64

**What this paper does NOT validate:**

❌ Continuum compactification (no s1_size→∞ extrapolation)  
❌ S⁶ or S³×S⁶ manifolds (only S², S³, S¹, S²×S¹ tested)  
❌ Standard Model derivation (no gauge group, no fermion generations)  
❌ Physical chirality (Dirac indices are topological toy counts)  
❌ Physical extra dimensions (Anderson benchmark is numerical test, not physical mechanism)  
❌ Observable predictions (toy diagnostics, not continuum field theory)

**Explicit note:** This is **NOT** a physical compactification proof. This is a **methodological contribution** demonstrating that falsification-first workflows can detect localized failure modes and derive empirical production guidelines in toy spectral diagnostics.
