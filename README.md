# GeoSpectra Lab / Covariant Compactification Toy Lab

![Validation Harness](docs/111.png)

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.20252651.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20252651)

## Purpose

GeoSpectra Lab is a reproducible Python MVP for testing toy mechanisms related
to covariant compactification ideas. It is a scientific-computing workbench, not
a claim that covariant compactification has been proven.

The current MVP tests:

- Radion stabilization in explicitly defined toy potentials.
- Spectral localization diagnostics through Anderson-style benchmarks.
- Analytic spectra on simple compact spaces such as `S2`, `S3`, `S6`, and
  product spectra.
- Scientific logging of discoveries, null results, and unresolved caveats.

The project value is the reproducible filter: it should show where a toy
hypothesis survives, where it fails, and which unexpected signals need follow-up.

## Research Context and Inspiration

GeoSpectra Lab is an independent computational project focused on falsification-first validation of finite-lattice spectral toy geometries.

The project was initially inspired by broader questions in compact product geometries, Kaluza–Klein-style reasoning, and covariant compactification, including public work by Tom Lawrence on product manifolds and covariant compactification.

GeoSpectra does **not** test or validate covariant compactification directly. It does **not** claim evidence for physical compactification, Standard Model structure, chirality, gauge-field derivation, or a thermodynamic/continuum limit.

Instead, the project asks a narrower computational question:

> Can a finite-lattice spectral validation harness distinguish a robust localization-like signal on a compact product toy geometry from artifacts of disorder strength, matrix sparsity, operator family, seed choice, spectral tails, metric handling, or geometry scrambling?

**Current case study:**

- Geometry: `S³×S¹` finite-lattice toy geometry
- Disorder: Anderson-style diagonal disorder
- Main diagnostic: true eigenvector-based IPR
- Secondary diagnostic: adjacent gap ratio / r-statistic
- Current milestone: Gate 4B v0.1.21 — `PASS_WITH_CAVEATS`
- Active validation branch: v0.1.22 Negative Controls / Artifact Zoo

**For detailed research context, see:** [`docs/RESEARCH_CONTEXT.md`](docs/RESEARCH_CONTEXT.md)

## What This Project Does NOT Prove

- It does not prove covariant compactification.
- It does not bypass Witten/Lichnerowicz no-go theorems.
- It does not prove chiral fermions.
- It does not prove protected chiral zero modes from near-zero modes.
- It does not derive the Standard Model gauge group `SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1)`.
- It does not validate real cosmology or real extra-dimensional stabilization.
- A future GOE -> Poisson signal, if observed, is a localization signal only.
  It is not evidence for chirality without an index calculation.

## Current Baseline: v0.1.15-s2-s1-product-discretized-full

**Previous baseline:** v0.1.14-mvp-s2-s1-discretization-v2-full (2026-05-14)

This baseline is the verified state after completing the full product-discretized
S² × S¹ diagnostic (6615 cases) and targeted ring/alpha=0 follow-up (1349 cases)
with refined caveat scope. The control ladder is now fixed as
follows: toy Dirac localization/chirality remains the negative control with
zero numerical index, the finite-mode `S2` monopole remains the positive
control with nonzero index, `S2 monopole x graph` remains the historical
artificial intermediate bridge, and `S2 x S1` is now the first geometric
product-operator bridge that passed the configured full profile.

- Basic checks passed: weak reference closer to GOE than Poisson, strong
  reference moved toward Poisson, and IPR increased.
- This is stronger than quick mode, but it is still a configured benchmark on
  small lattices. It does not prove localization in a target physical model.

Pending:

- Full spectrum-window diagnostics remain pending: quantile windows are
  implemented in `--full` mode but have not been verified.
- Larger 3D Anderson scaling remains pending: bigger `L`, more seeds, finer
  W-grid, and boundary-condition comparison.

## 3D Anderson Full Benchmark

The 3D benchmark replaces the old weak 1D quick smoke as the next localization
diagnostic. The configured full mode uses `L = 4, 5, 6, 7`, eight disorder
values, and eight realizations per point. It uses a cubic lattice with open
boundaries by default:

```text
H_ij = epsilon_i delta_ij + t * nearest_neighbor_terms
epsilon_i ~ Uniform[-W/2, W/2]
```

Command:

```powershell
python scripts/anderson_3d_benchmark.py --full
```

Run path:

```text
reports/RUNS/20260511-232546_anderson_3d_benchmark_full
```

Final-size `L=7` full results:

| W | `<r>` | stderr_r | mean IPR | stderr_ipr |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | `0.4858` | `0.0144` | `0.00913076` | `4.9e-05` |
| 2 | `0.5083` | `0.0183` | `0.00874612` | `2.6e-05` |
| 4 | `0.5182` | `0.0149` | `0.00997714` | `0.00011` |
| 8 | `0.5204` | `0.0161` | `0.0225568` | `0.00063` |
| 12 | `0.5058` | `0.0101` | `0.0619373` | `0.0048` |
| 16 | `0.4667` | `0.0121` | `0.140325` | `0.0077` |
| 20 | `0.4358` | `0.0151` | `0.225139` | `0.014` |
| 24 | `0.3978` | `0.0125` | `0.316232` | `0.016` |

Basic checks passed:

- Weak reference `W=4` is closer to GOE than Poisson.
- Strong reference `W=24` moved close to Poisson relative to weak reference.
- IPR increased from weak to strong disorder.

Limitations:

- This is benchmark validation only, not proof of a target physical model.
- Lattices are still small and realizations remain limited.
- Open boundary conditions are used by default; periodic boundaries still need
  comparison.
- Larger finite-size scaling is still needed.
- Spectrum-window diagnostics are quick-verified for center/lower/upper windows;
  full quantile-window validation is pending.
- This does not prove localization in the target physical model, chirality, or
  covariant compactification.

## 3D Anderson Spectrum-Window Diagnostics

Spectrum-window diagnostics test whether the Anderson localization diagnostic
depends on the selected spectral region. Quick mode checks center, lower-band,
and upper-band windows.

Quick command:

```powershell
python scripts/anderson_3d_spectrum_windows.py --quick
```

Full command:

```powershell
python scripts/anderson_3d_spectrum_windows.py --full
```

Full mode has been run and produced a mixed/limiting result. It did not promote
the baseline at the time; the historical promotion baseline then remained
`v0.1.8-mvp-dirac-localization-full`. It adds quantile windows
`quantile_0.1`, `quantile_0.3`, `quantile_0.5`, `quantile_0.7`, and
`quantile_0.9`.

| upper | `0.5808` | `0.3960` | `0.0204236` | `0.344342` | True |

Quick result summary:

- `all_windows_basic_checks_passed=True`
- `window_choice_changes_conclusion=False`
- Window choice did not change the basic localization diagnostic in this run.

- `reports/RUNS/20260512-081650_anderson_3d_spectrum_windows_quick/figures/window_comparison_heatmap.png`

Interpretation:

The quick run reduces concern that the configured 3D Anderson result is only a
center-window artifact. It still does not prove target physical localization,
chirality, covariant compactification, Witten/Lichnerowicz bypass, or Standard
Model physics.

- `boundary_changes_basic_diagnostic=True`
- `max_abs_delta_r=0.0804`
- `max_abs_delta_ipr=0.116229`
- Interpretation: open and periodic boundaries disagree under the current
  strong-disorder pass/fail criterion, so this is a recorded limitation.

This does not prove target-model localization, chirality, covariant
compactification, Witten/Lichnerowicz bypass, or Standard Model physics.

  baseline then remained `v0.1.8-mvp-dirac-localization-full`.
- This updates the boundary limitation but does not erase the earlier failed
  open-vs-periodic comparison.

This is still benchmark diagnosis only. It does not prove target-model
localization, chirality, covariant compactification, Witten/Lichnerowicz
bypass, or Standard Model physics.

## Full Toy Dirac/Geometric Localization Benchmark

This benchmark applies the calibrated localization diagnostics to finite chiral
block toy operators:

```text
D = [[0, A], [A^dagger, 0]]
```

Supported modes are `clean`, `random_mass`, `gauge_phase`, and
`geometric_weight`.

Command:

```powershell
python scripts/dirac_localization_benchmark.py --full
python scripts/dirac_chirality_diagnostic.py --full
python scripts/s2_graph_intermediate.py --quick
```

Run:

```text
reports/RUNS/20260512-130351_dirac_localization_full
```

Final `size=96` mode assessment:

| mode | weak W | strong W | weak IPR | strong IPR | weak `<r>` | strong `<r>` | IPR increases | r toward Poisson | near-zero signal |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| clean | 0 | 8 | `0.0104167` | `0.0104167` | `0.9259` | `0.9259` | False | False | True |
| gauge_phase | 0 | 8 | `0.0104167` | `0.00520833` | `0.9259` | `0.3329` | False | True | True |
| geometric_weight | 0 | 8 | `0.0104167` | `0.135186` | `0.9259` | `0.3798` | True | True | True |
| random_mass | 0 | 8 | `0.0104167` | `0.315382` | `0.9259` | `0.3785` | True | True | True |

Summary:

- `all_symmetry_checks_passed=True`
- `any_near_zero_modes=True`
- IPR increases in `random_mass` and `geometric_weight`.
- r-statistics moves toward Poisson in `random_mass`, `gauge_phase`, and
  `geometric_weight`.
- `clean` remains a no-localization reference.
- `gauge_phase` moves r-statistics toward Poisson, but near-zero IPR does not
  increase.
- Near-zero modes are numerical signals only, not protected chiral zero modes.
- Historical promotion baseline: `v0.1.8-mvp-dirac-localization-full`.

This connects benchmark diagnostics to toy Dirac-like operators, but it does
not prove physical chirality, Witten/Lichnerowicz bypass, covariant
compactification, or Standard Model fermions.

## Radion Module

The radion module implements a reproducible toy stabilization experiment.

Files:

- `cc_toy_lab/radion/potentials.py`
- `cc_toy_lab/radion/dynamics.py`
- `cc_toy_lab/radion/mfg.py`
- `cc_toy_lab/radion/phase_transition.py`
- `cc_toy_lab/radion/dashboard.py`
- `scripts/radion_stabilization.py`

Implemented toy potentials:

| Potential | Form | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | `a/R^2` | Unstable baseline; no stabilizing finite minimum. |
| B | `a/R^2 + b R^2` | Minimal stabilizing potential. |
| C | `a/R^2 + b R^2 + c/R^4` | Stabilizing potential with Casimir-like correction. |
| D | `B + toy-regularized KK tower` | Toy KK correction; not a full quantum effective energy. |

Default target and controls:

- `R0_B` target: approximately `1.1892`.
- `alpha_c`: `1.345`.
- MFG dynamics use agents attracted to `1/R`.
- The phase scan checks a toy threshold transition near `alpha_c`.

Current assert checks cover:

- Potential B minimum near `R0_B`.
- Positive curvature at the B minimum.
- Five stable trajectories converging to the same attractor.
- MFG self-consistency against `1/R0_B`.
- Grid-invariant alpha-threshold smoke check.

Dashboard panels:

1. Effective potentials A-D.
2. Curvature / stability at minima.
3. Stable trajectories for potential B.
4. Potential A trajectories showing no false stabilization.
5. MFG self-consistency: `R(t)` and mean field `x_bar(t)`.
6. Toy phase transition: `R0(alpha)` and order parameter.

Interpretation limits:

- The radion result proves only that the specified toy equations stabilize under
  the chosen parameters.
- It does not prove real extra-dimensional stabilization.
- It does not prove a correct quantum effective action.
- It does not remove the need for physical model-building and stability checks.

## Spectral Module

The spectral module implements localization diagnostics and toy Dirac checks.

Files:

- `cc_toy_lab/spectral/anderson.py`
- `cc_toy_lab/spectral/metrics.py`
- `cc_toy_lab/spectral/toy_dirac.py`
- `cc_toy_lab/spectral/unfolding.py`
- `cc_toy_lab/spectral/localization.py`
- `scripts/spectral_localization.py`

Implemented diagnostics:

- Anderson benchmark.
- Adjacent-gap ratio `<r>`.
- IPR, inverse participation ratio.
- Toy Dirac block symmetry check.
- Finite-size smoke plotting.

Reference values used for interpretation:

| Ensemble | Expected `<r>` |
| --- | ---: |
| Poisson | about `0.3863` |
| GOE | about `0.5307` |
| GUE | about `0.5996` |

Current quick-mode null result:

- `python scripts/spectral_localization.py --quick` was run.
- It created `reports/FIGURES/spectral_localization_dashboard.png`.
- In quick mode, weak disorder `W=0.5` produced `<r>=0.2631`.
- This is not closer to GOE than to Poisson.
- The result is logged as a null/limiting result, not hidden as success.

Why this should not be overinterpreted:

- Quick mode is a smoke test, not full spectral validation.
- The current benchmark is a compact 1D Anderson-style control. Weak-disorder
  behavior in this setup should not be treated as a general GOE claim.
- Localization metrics do not prove chirality.
- Near-zero modes do not prove protected chiral zero modes.
- A GOE -> Poisson transition, if later observed in a stronger model, would
  still be only a localization signal unless a Dirac index and chiral quantum
  numbers are checked.

Pending full spectral work:

- Full default sweep: `N=512`, `30` disorder values, `30` realizations.
- Stronger Anderson model: 3D or quasi-dimensional geometry.
- Dirac index control before any chirality claims.

Synthetic r-statistics controls:

- `python scripts/r_stat_controls.py --quick` validates the statistic pipeline on
  Poisson, GOE, and optional GUE synthetic spectra.
- `python scripts/r_stat_controls.py --full` runs the larger synthetic control
  configuration. This mode is verified in the current baseline.
- This control validates the statistic implementation only. It is not a physics
  result and does not validate Anderson localization by itself.

Current full control results:

| Ensemble | Expected `<r>` | Measured `<r>` | Tolerance | Passed |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Poisson | `0.3863` | `0.3817` | `0.0350` | yes |
| GOE | `0.5307` | `0.5309` | `0.0400` | yes |
| GUE optional | `0.5996` | `0.5960` | `0.0450` | yes |

Why this matters: `mean_adjacent_gap_ratio` now passes independent synthetic
Poisson/GOE/GUE controls in quick and full modes. This reduces the risk that the Anderson
quick null-result comes from a broken r-statistics implementation.

What this does not prove: no Anderson localization claim, no chirality claim,
no physics validation, no Witten/Lichnerowicz no-go bypass, and no covariant
compactification claim follows from these synthetic controls.

## S2 Dirac Monopole Index Control

The S2 monopole control is the first chirality-related validation layer in the
project. It is a finite-mode spectral toy model with a documented convention:

```text
q > 0 has positive-chirality zero modes
q < 0 has negative-chirality zero modes
index(D) = n_plus - n_minus = q
```

Commands:

```powershell
python scripts/dirac_monopole_s2.py --quick
python scripts/dirac_monopole_s2.py --full
```

The full run checks `q = -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3` over cutoffs
`1, 2, 3, 5`. The latest verified full run is:

```text
reports/RUNS/20260511-230305_dirac_monopole_s2_full
```

This validates index-counting infrastructure and chirality bookkeeping on a
known finite-mode toy control. It does not prove physical chiral fermions,
does not bypass Witten/Lichnerowicz no-go theorems, and does not derive
Standard Model fermions.

## Geometry Module

The geometry module provides analytic controls for compact spaces:

- Scalar curvature of round spheres.
- Laplacian eigenvalues on `S^n_R`.
- Degeneracies of spherical harmonics.
- Product spectrum sum rules, including `S3 x S6`.
- Sphere sampling and graph-Laplacian helpers for later numerical checks.

Interpretation limits:

- Reproducing `S3 x S6` product spectra does not show that `S3 x S6` is a
  cosmological vacuum.
- It does not derive gauge fields or the Standard Model.
- Graph Laplacian approximations on high-dimensional spheres are sensitive to
  sampling, kNN choices, and scale parameters.

## Scientific Logs

The project keeps scientific bookkeeping separate from code output.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `reports/DISCOVERY_LEDGER.md` | Unexpected findings, hypotheses, suspected artifacts, and toy signals. |
| `reports/NULL_RESULTS.md` | Negative results and failed hypotheses. These are first-class results. |
| `reports/ISSUES_SCIENTIFIC.md` | Scientific caveats, contested assumptions, and overclaiming risks. |

Rules for interpretation:

- Do not call a finding an observation until the data and config are saved.
- Do not call an observation a toy signal until it is reproduced across seeds or controls.
- Do not call a toy signal a physical result without the relevant physical
  invariant, such as an index calculation for chirality.

## Known Limitations

- The current spectral quick mode produced a null/limiting weak-disorder result.
- Synthetic r-statistics controls validate the statistic pipeline, not Anderson
  physics.
- The configured full 3D Anderson benchmark passed basic checks, but larger
  scaling remains pending.
- Full quantile-window diagnostics produced a mixed `quantile_0.5` result;
  targeted follow-up reduced that concern but did not remove the need for
  larger scaling.
- Open-vs-periodic boundary comparison produced a boundary-sensitive limitation:
  open boundaries passed the current check, while periodic boundaries did not.
- The periodic-boundary follow-up suggests the earlier periodic failure is
  likely an insufficient-disorder-range issue at `W=24`, with finite-size and
  seed-count sensitivity. This reduces the concern but does not promote the
  baseline.
- The full `S1` discretization comparison with `spectral_circle`, `ring`, and
  `wilson_ring` is mixed/limiting: `ring` fails
  `localization_gate_passed=False` on the full profile while the reference
  `spectral_circle` and `wilson_ring` remain clean. This blocks promotion to a
  discretization-robust full baseline.
- Anderson model physics is not fully validated.
- The toy Dirac/geometric localization benchmark is quick-only so far. It
  reports localization diagnostics on finite chiral block operators, not
  physical chirality or an index result.
- Physical chirality in a compactification model is not validated.
- The S2 monopole result is a finite-mode index-pipeline control, not a
  physical chiral-fermion construction.
- The legacy `scripts/spectral_localization.py` default sweep has not been
  rerun after the 3D benchmark upgrade.
- Spectrum-window diagnostics are quick-verified for center/lower/upper windows.
  The full quantile-window run produced a mixed result driven by `quantile_0.5`;
  targeted follow-up classifies it as likely statistical/finite-size/seed-count
  sensitivity.
- The spectral benchmark still needs boundary-sensitivity diagnosis and
  larger-size controls before it can support broad localization conclusions.
- The radion phase transition is a toy threshold model pinned to `alpha_c=1.345`,
  not a derived physical critical point.
- Potential D uses toy regularization of a KK tower, not a complete one-loop
  quantum effective energy.
- The toy Dirac/geometric localization operator checks finite block symmetry and
  numerical localization metrics. It is not an index test.
- No result in this MVP establishes protected chiral zero modes.
- No result in this MVP derives `SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1)`.
- The folder is not currently a git repository, so baseline versioning is
  documented by file state and reports rather than commits or tags.

## Next Validation Steps

Priority order:

1. Complete v0.1.22 Negative Controls execution (batches 3-6 on remote infrastructure)
2. Diagnose why `ring` fails `localization_gate_passed` on the full
   `S1`-discretization comparison while `spectral_circle` and `wilson_ring`
   pass.
3. Add product-level figures if they improve interpretation without overclaim.
4. Move to product-discretized geometric refinements before any `S6` or
   `S3 x S6` step.
5. Repeat periodic-boundary follow-up with larger `L` if feasible, more seeds,
   and explicit open-reference matching at the same resolution.
6. Increase `L`, seed count, and W-grid resolution.
7. Test window-width sensitivity for `quantile_0.5`.
8. Test mobility-edge behavior across spectral windows.
9. Check dense/sparse eigensolver consistency for the larger Anderson runs.
10. Add geometry spectrum validation for `S2`, `S3`, `S6`, and `S3 x S6`.

The strongest next chirality-related step is an independent geometric
discretization of the `S2` Dirac monopole operator. It should test whether the
index-counting result survives a construction less directly tied to the known
finite-mode spectrum.

## Toy Dirac Chirality/Index Diagnostic

This diagnostic adds `Gamma = diag(+I, -I)` to the toy Dirac localization
operators and checks whether near-zero modes carry a nonzero numerical index.

Command:

```powershell
python scripts/dirac_chirality_diagnostic.py --full
```

Run:

```text
reports\RUNS\20260512-135933_dirac_chirality_full
```

Summary:

- `gamma_algebra_passed=True`
- `anticommutation_preserved=True`
- `all_indices_zero=True`
- `any_near_zero_modes=True`
- Historical promotion baseline: `v0.1.10-mvp-dirac-chirality-full`

Interpretation:

The current toy localization near-zero modes are classified as paired or
accidental under this diagnostic because the numerical index remains zero. This
does not contradict the verified `S2` monopole index control; it says the toy
localization modes have not produced protected/chiral zero modes.

## S2 Monopole x Graph Intermediate Bridge

This is the first intermediate toy bridge where a nonzero index and a
localization diagnostic coexist in one controlled model.

Role of the three controls:

- Negative control: toy Dirac localization/chirality has near-zero modes, but
  the numerical index remains `0`, so the modes are classified as paired or
  accidental rather than protected/chiral zero modes.
- Positive control: finite-mode `S2` monopole verifies `index(D) = q` and shows
  that the index pipeline can detect nonzero topological index.
- Intermediate bridge: finite-mode `S2 monopole x graph` combines the verified
  nonzero-index `S2` sector with graph-sector localization diagnostics in one
  toy bridge.

The index is inherited from the verified `S2` monopole sector, while the graph
sector acts as an artificial localization selector inside the zero-mode sector.

Command:

```powershell
python scripts/s2_graph_intermediate.py --quick
```

Run:

```text
reports\RUNS\20260512-141913_s2_graph_intermediate_quick
```

Summary:

- `all_index_checks_passed=True`
- `all_anticommutators_preserved=True`
- `ipr_growth_observed=True`
- Baseline: `v0.1.11-mvp-s2-graph-intermediate-quick`

- `reports/RUNS/20260512-141913_s2_graph_intermediate_quick/figures/chirality_counts.png`

Interpretation:

This toy bridge shows index plus localization diagnostics simultaneously in a
controlled intermediate model. It is not continuum `S2 x S1`, not `S6`, not
`S3 x S6`, not a physical compactification claim, and not a Standard Model
fermion derivation. It does not validate covariant compactification and does
not bypass Witten/Lichnerowicz no-go results.

## S2 × S1 Product-Operator Benchmark

This is the first bridge where the auxiliary `S1` factor enters the toy
operator itself rather than appearing only as an external selector.

Progression of controls:

- Negative control: toy Dirac localization/chirality has near-zero modes, but
  the numerical index remains `0`.
- Positive control: finite-mode `S2` monopole verifies `index(D)=q`.
- Historical artificial bridge: `S2 monopole x graph` preserves inherited index
  while the graph sector acts as a localization selector.
- First geometric product-operator bridge: `S2 x S1` inserts the circle factor
  directly into the operator:

```text
D_{S2xS1} = D_{S2}(q) ⊗ I_{S1} + Γ_{S2} ⊗ P_{S1}(α, W)
```

Interpretation:

This is a toy product diagnostic. It checks inherited `S2` monopole kernel
behavior together with `S1` twist and localization response inside one toy
operator. The full configured profile retained the same benchmark-level
classification and passed all basic gates. Full-product global chiral index is
not the headline metric here.

Explicit non-claims:

- no continuum compactification;
- no `S6` / `S3 x S6`;
- no Standard Model derivation;
- no physical chirality proof;
- no Witten/Lichnerowicz bypass.

Next steps:

1. Diagnose why the full-profile `ring` family loses
   `localization_gate_passed`.
2. Add figures if they help interpretation.
3. Explore product-discretized geometric refinements.
4. Only then move toward `S6` or `S3 x S6`.
5. Keep the historical negative control, positive control, and `S2 x graph`
   bridge visible when interpreting the new `S2 x S1` full baseline.

## S1 Discretization Robustness Quick Comparison

This follow-up checks whether the current toy `S2 x S1` bridge depends strongly
on the `spectral_circle` construction or survives first alternative `S1`
families.

Interpretation:

This is a discretization-robustness test, not a new product-geometry claim. On
the current quick comparison profile, both alternative families, `ring` and
`wilson_ring`, match the reference `spectral_circle` benchmark-level conclusion
and preserve all basic gates.

Explicit non-claims:

- no continuum compactification;
- no `S6` / `S3 x S6`;
- no Standard Model derivation;
- no physical chirality proof;
- no Witten/Lichnerowicz bypass.

- `reports/RUNS/20260512-191838_s1_discretization_comparison_full/figures/`

Interpretation:

This is a mixed discretization-robustness result, not a new baseline. The full
profile stays clean for `spectral_circle` and `wilson_ring`, but `ring` loses
the localization gate while preserving the rest of the benchmark checks. The
safest classification is full-profile discretization sensitivity in the current
toy `S2 x S1` benchmark, not continuum compactification and not a physical
chirality result.

Next diagnostic step:

```powershell
python scripts/s2_s1_product.py --full
```

with targeted follow-up on the `ring` family to localize why
`localization_gate_passed` fails under the full comparison grid.
