# Research Context

## Scientific Motivation

GeoSpectra Lab is an independent computational project focused on **falsification-first validation** of finite-lattice spectral toy geometries.

The broader research question:

> Can compact product geometries support localization-like spectral signals that are robust against disorder, discretization family, finite-size scaling, and artifact tests?

This question appears in multiple research contexts:

1. **Kaluza-Klein compactification** (historical framework, 1920s–present)
2. **Lattice field theory** (computational QFT, contemporary)
3. **Covariant compactification** (geometric approaches to extra dimensions)
4. **Anderson localization on curved spaces** (condensed matter physics)

GeoSpectra focuses on the **computational/numerical validation side**: falsification-first testing of finite-lattice toy geometries with explicit artifact controls.

## Inspiration and Attribution

This project was initially inspired by broader questions in compact product geometries, Kaluza–Klein-style reasoning, and geometric approaches to extra-dimensional compactification, including public work by **Tom Lawrence** on product manifolds and covariant compactification.

**Key distinction:**

GeoSpectra does **not** test or validate covariant compactification directly. It does **not** claim evidence for physical compactification, Standard Model structure, chirality, gauge-field derivation, or a thermodynamic/continuum limit.

Instead, the project asks a **narrower computational question**:

> Can a finite-lattice spectral validation harness distinguish a robust localization-like signal on a compact product toy geometry from artifacts of disorder strength, matrix sparsity, operator family, seed choice, spectral tails, metric handling, or geometry scrambling?

## What GeoSpectra Studies

### Current case study: S³×S¹

- **Geometry:** S³×S¹ finite-lattice toy geometry (N ≤ 896)
- **Disorder:** Anderson-style diagonal disorder (on-site U(r) ∈ [-W, W])
- **Main diagnostic:** True eigenvector-based IPR (inverse participation ratio)
- **Secondary diagnostic:** Adjacent gap ratio / r-statistic
- **Current milestone:** Gate 4B v0.1.21 — `GATE4B_FSS_PASS_WITH_CAVEATS`
- **Active validation branch:** v0.1.22 Negative Controls (artifact falsification)

### Why S³×S¹?

- **S³:** Simplest non-trivial compact 3-manifold
- **S¹:** Simplest compactification target
- **Product geometry:** Tests separability vs coupling
- **Finite lattice:** Computationally tractable (hours, not weeks)

## What GeoSpectra Does NOT Study

GeoSpectra does **not** study:

- Physical extra dimensions
- Thermodynamic limit (N → ∞)
- Continuum field theory
- Standard Model gauge group derivation
- Real cosmology or physical stabilization
- Chiral fermion construction (beyond toy index controls)
- Witten/Lichnerowicz no-go theorem bypass

**All results are finite-lattice, toy-model, computational.**

## Falsification-First Methodology

GeoSpectra uses a **falsification-first** validation harness:

1. **Pre-registration:** Define protocol before execution
2. **Negative controls:** Test if broken/random/scrambled baselines reproduce signal
3. **Artifact zoo:** Systematically test known failure modes
4. **Null results logging:** Failed hypotheses are first-class results
5. **Explicit claim boundaries:** Document what can/cannot be claimed

**Example (v0.1.22):**

Negative controls protocol:
- Random Hermitian baseline
- Scrambled geometry (broken S³×S¹ structure)
- Broken Wilson term

**Expected outcome:** Controls should fail (NOT reproduce Gate 4B robustness).  
**Danger result:** If ANY control shows Gate 4B-like pattern → harness lacks specificity.

## Computational Resources

Some planned experiments require larger computational resources than currently available on local hardware. Heavy runs are being executed remotely where possible (Google Colab, cloud instances, or university clusters).

Current bottleneck: Local thermal constraint prevents extended batch execution.
